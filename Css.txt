A library is a collection of reusable code modules or functions that can be directly called by an application to perform specific tasks or operations.
In a library, the control flow of the application remains with the developer. The developer decides when and how to use the library's functionalities.
A framework is a more comprehensive software package that provides a structured architecture and a set of rules, conventions, and pre-defined functionalities to guide the development of an application.
In a framework, the control flow of the application is inverted. Instead of the developer calling the framework's functionalities, the framework calls the developer's code at specific points according to its predefined structure.
